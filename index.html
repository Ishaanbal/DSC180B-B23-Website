            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>We explore the unknown off-target space of Pralsetinib, a recently approved RET kinase inhibitor, to predict potential adverse effects. By constructing a neuro-symbolic knowledge graph enriched with biomedical ontologies, we aim to link drug mechanisms directly to toxicity. Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on this graph, we predict off-target proteins and associated diseases/adverse events. Our GNN model successfully recovered all held-out known targets within the top 20 predictions, providing a strong foundation for generating safety-relevant hypotheses for new drugs.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Pralsetinib is a recently approved targeted therapy with limited long-term real-world safety data. Post-marketing pharmacovigilance has already revealed unexpected adverse effects beyond its primary on-target mechanisms (e.g., rhabdomyolysis, severe infections). Due to its complex kinase biology, there is a significant "unknown off-target space". In this study, we build a neuro-symbolic knowledge graph that links mechanisms to toxicity, enriching it with Gene Ontology (GO) and target-outcome links. By running a GNN over the full graph, we generate ranked predictions for potential off-target proteins and their associated adverse effects, offering valuable hypotheses for drug safety.</p>

        <section id="methods">
            <h2>Methods</h2>
            <h3>Knowledge Graph Construction</h3>
            <p>We extracted edges and nodes from multiple sources, including PubChem (bioactivity, consolidated targets, clinical trials, chemical/gene co-occurrences) and literature text mining for adverse events, forming our initial relationships.</p>
    
            <h3>Enrichment & Expansion</h3>
            <p>We expanded the graph by integrating GO pathways and target-outcome associations. We further expanded the protein set using the STRING PPI network and UniProt human kinases, drastically increasing the candidate space for prediction.</p>
    
            <h3>GNN Off-Target Prediction</h3>
            <p>We trained a Graph Neural Network on the full graph to predict missing <code>(drug, inhibits, protein)</code> and <code>(protein, associated_with, Disease/AE)</code> links. A simple baseline model summing KG edge weights was used for comparison. Path-based reasoning was generated to explain the predicted links.</p>
        </section>
    
        <section id="results">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <h3>Knowledge Graph Statistics</h3>
            <p>The final enriched and expanded graph consists of 1,084 nodes and 1,464 edges. The expansion increased our candidate protein set by approximately 34-fold, resulting in 516 candidates for ranking alongside 13 known Pralsetinib targets.</p>
    
            <h3>Prediction Performance</h3>
            <p>We evaluated our GNN on a held-out test set of known Pralsetinib targets. The model achieved a Recall@5 of 25%, Recall@10 of 50%, and Recall@20 of 100%, successfully recovering all four held-out targets within the top 20 predictions (Mean Rank: 11.5, MRR: 0.147). The multi-hop structure utilized by the GNN significantly outperformed the baseline model.</p>
    
            <h3>Interactive Visualization</h3>
            <p>We developed an interactive PyVis HTML visualization of the knowledge graph to explore the mechanistic pathways linking Pralsetinib to predicted diseases and adverse events.</p>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Our neuro-symbolic, ontology-based approach demonstrates that GNNs can effectively leverage complex biomedical knowledge graphs to predict drug off-targets. By successfully identifying known targets and proposing novel candidates with path-based reasoning, this framework provides a powerful tool for early pharmacovigilance and hypothesis generation regarding the safety profiles of newly approved therapeutics.</p>
